*A lightweight, high-performance database for analytics and data science.*

## 📌 What is DuckDB?
[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) is an **in-process, columnar, OLAP database** designed for fast analytical queries on structured data. Unlike traditional databases, DuckDB operates **fully in-memory** and requires **no external server**, making it ideal for **data analysis, machine learning, and ETL workflows**.

## 🚀 Why Use DuckDB?

✅ **Lightweight & Serverless** – No need for setup; just install and use.  
✅ **Blazing Fast Analytics** – Optimized for columnar storage and vectorized query execution.  
✅ **SQL Support** – Works like PostgreSQL, with full SQL compatibility.  
✅ **Seamless Integration** – Compatible with **Python, R, Pandas, Parquet, and CSV files**.  
✅ **Great for ETL** – Load, transform, and export data efficiently.

📀 **Example Use Case:**

## 🔥 How to Use DuckDB

### **1️⃣ Querying a CSV File Directly**
```sql
SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('life_expectancy.csv') LIMIT 5;
```

### **2️⃣ Creating a Table and Inserting Data**
```sql
CREATE TABLE life_expectancy (
    Country VARCHAR,
    Female_Life_Expectancy DOUBLE,
    Both_Sexes_Life_Expectancy DOUBLE,
    Male_Life_Expectancy DOUBLE
);

INSERT INTO life_expectancy VALUES
    ('Zanthera', 82.3, 78.9, 75.1),
    ('Drakonia', 85.7, 80.5, 75.8);
```

### **3️⃣ Exporting Data to a CSV**
```sql
COPY life_expectancy TO 'updated_life_expectancy.csv' (HEADER, DELIMITER ',');
```
